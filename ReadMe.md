# Language quiz ❔
## Objectives
- Apply OOP in PHP
- Adhere to the [best practises](../00.Getting-started-with-PHP/PHP-best-practises.md) we've assembled together

## Specifications
There might be days when you feel tired of learning how to code, maybe you want to learn a new language instead? We'll combine both skills by building a language quiz! To get you kickstarted, a starter pack is provided 🚀

### 🌱 Must-haves
- Give the player a word to translate
- Validate the player's answer on submit, displaying a success / fail message

### 🌼 Nice-to-haves (doable)
- Save the player's score when they want to translate another word
- Allow the player to click a reset button and start over completely

### 🌳 Nice-to-haves (hard)
- Ask the player's nickname before the quiz starts
- Create a scoreboard for right and wrong answers
- Display an end screen with the total score when the player reaches 10 right or wrong answers
